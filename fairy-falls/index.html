I always had this photo and wanted it digitized to keep forever."><p>I grew up in a household where there were a large number of photos taken while I was growing up. Some of these were from my mom simply snapping them as I was playing as a child, while others were of the usual birthday and holiday variety. As I grew up, I began to find my own interest in photography, and started shooting just about anything and everything I could with anything from a point and shoot camera to a Poloroid. As I entered my teens, I was lucky enough to borrow an old Canon 35mm camera and I was on my way to many fun years of shooting. As an adult, my love for photography only grew, and I was buying rolls of film to go off on another adventure to find something fun to capture with whatever camera I had at the time. Then the world of digital came along, and all my old photos lay in boxes, or in photo albums which were collecting dust on a shelf somewhere. My mother started going through all her photos and bringing photos I hadn’t seen in decades over to see if I wanted them. I began reminiscing and thinking how great it would be to have them all in a digital format and on my computer.This is where the gears in my head started turning, and I thought, “Why don’t I just get a nice scanner and do this all myself”? Then I had a flashback to trying that very thing many years before, and how frustrating it was to sit and wait for the scans, then crop them, followed by naming and trying to organize everything. I knew there had to be a better solution...so my search began.</p><p>I would have never guessed the can of worms I was about to open by simply typing in something like “photo scanning” or “online photo scanning” into the Google search box. If you have never tried this before, you would be amazed at the results. The problem isn’t a lack of choices, but rather the opposite. I found myself delving into the craziness and clicking away to see what I could find. Many of these services offer different price tiers, mainly due to different scanning resolutions, and number of prints. I realized very quickly that once you ship your photos to one of these companies, they then send them overseas to be scanned, then return them when they are finished. You actually have to pay more money to have them scanned in the United States. For some reason, it didn’t sit well in my gut that a picture of little me in a studio with my double-chin and shag carpet background had what seemed to be a large chance of getting lost or damaged on such a long trip. I wasn’t worried about them going outside the United States because of quality, but it seemed rather stupid that they had to be sent out of country to simply be scanned. This is when I decided to search for something along the lines of “USA based photo scanning” and found the perfect solution for my needs, VistaPix Media.</p><p>I began by looking through the VistaPix Media site for details and pricing like on all other sites I had previously. I was pleasantly surprised to find that for $59, I would get 500 of my precious photos scanned, put on a disc and returned to me. I had to read it a few times over, as all the other places I had found were charging for more for this service, and sending it overseas. Did I mention they are scanned by hand, one by one? Go to one of the sites that “mass scans” and watch your precious photos flip through a huge machine that looks like it could rip them apart at any given second, no thank you.</p><p>My decision had been made, I was going to pull the trigger and give it a shot. I noticed a coupon for $10 off your first order. In order to receive the coupon code, you simply write to them, and they will respond with the code so you can place your order.* I send off a quick note to them, and received a very quick response from not just anybody, but rather Vista herself. If you read the story on the VistaPix Media site, you will find she started the company herself, and has a team of military spouses and veterans working for her. I asked Vista a few more questions, and once I received my answers, I was off and counting out 500 photos to send in.</p><p>The process is very easy. I placed my order online, and simply waited a few days for my prepaid FedEx box to show for me to put my photos in. Once it arrived, I filled it with my 500 photos, dropped it off at FedEx, and waited to hear the box arrived. Even though I had a tracking number for my photos, I received a message from VistaPix Media when they arrived, which I thought was great. After only a few days of being at VistaPix Media, I received another message saying they were scanned and back to me with a tracking number included. Once they were on their way back to me, I realized I had made a mistake on the media I selected, as none of the computers in my home have a DVD drive, making it impossible to get them on my computer. I realized I should have selected the USB option, but it was too late, as they had already shipped. I wrote to Vista, and she said she would have one sent to me the next day without question. I asked her to not worry about it, as I had a work computer I could use. We exchanged another e-mail, and I ended up simply sharing a folder from a cloud service I use with her, and she uploaded them all within a couple of hours! How in the world can you beat this?</p><p>The quality of the scans is perfect, and I couldn't be more happy. What more could I ask for...amazing quality and service, along with supporting the amazing people and their families that keep us all safe and our freedom? Thank you Vista, and all of you at VistaPix Media...I'm already getting my next order ready!</p><p>I found a real business and a real person, not a company.</p><p>*Update - Since I placed my last order with Vistapix Media, the coupon process has been simplified. You now simply enter the code PIXSCAN10D for $10 off any scanning package.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">Fairy Falls</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
